Star Citizen Fan Site Kit plugin for WordPress will help you to quickly turn any WP into a site about the verse. It is however a WIP (work in progress).

== Description ==

Star Citizen Fan Site Kit plugin belongs to the games community. It is for them to support,
help develop, translate and use to create a lot of WordPress based fan sites. 

I predict the Star Citizen community will be one of the biggest gaming communities 
in gaming history. It's already a massively dedicated community that creates endless
fan content. This plugin is now a part of that movement. Anyone with web or graphics
development experience can add to this project.

= When To Update = 

Browse the changes log and decide if an update is required. There is nothing wrong with skipping version if it does not
help you - look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want
to avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version - do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation 
(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different
environment for WTG Task Manager - possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common
in software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the Star Citizen Fan Site Kit plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
